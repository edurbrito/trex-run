## Specs

This project was only developed for the MINIX environment using mainly the C language. There are various modules that control some of the computer components, like the Timer, the Keyboard, the Mouse, the RTC and ultimately the Video Card, allowing for the deepest of the interactions with the core functions of the system. The source code can be found inside the [src](src) folder.

All the game assets were made out of the [Google sprites](res/all_sprites.png), edited with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and exported as [bitmaps](res).
